## 🎯 Building Agents - Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific and Atomic

**Good Prompts:**
- "Click the 'Sign In' button in the top right corner"
- "Type my email address into the email field"
- "Extract the product price from the main product page"

**Avoid Vague Instructions:**
- "Do something interesting on the page"
- "Fill out the form and submit it" (combine multiple actions)

### 2. Use Variables for Sensitive Data

Instead of hardcoding sensitive information in your prompts, use variables:

**Action Field:** "Type %email% into the email field"
**Variables Section:** 
- email: "john.doe@example.com"

This keeps your personal information secure and makes agents reusable.

### 3. Preview Before Running

Use the **Preview Mode** to see what actions your agent will take before running it live:

1. Create your agent with prompts
2. Click "Preview Actions"
3. Review the planned steps
4. Adjust prompts if needed
5. Run with confidence

### 4. Start Simple, Then Expand

Begin with basic single-page interactions:

**Beginner:** "Click the search button"
**Intermediate:** "Search for products and filter by price range"
**Advanced:** "Compare prices across multiple e-commerce sites"

### 5. Use Community Agents

Browse our community library for pre-built agents:
- **Amazon Price Tracker**
- **LinkedIn Auto-Poster**
- **Google Maps Business Scraper**
- **Twitter Engagement Bot**
- **News Article Collector**
